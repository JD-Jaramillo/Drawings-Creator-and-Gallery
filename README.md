## Canvas
Created a drawing canvas using scss and JavaScript to allow the user to draw on the canvas using either a paintbrush, a pen or a bucket. 

## Routers
Added the routes for the back end to connect to the server and render the appropriate pages using handlebars.js when called upon. 

## Models
Added the models for the User and for the Drawings, and also made the neessary associations for the models to appropriately refer to each other. 

## Handlebars
Created handlebars using Handlebars.js to render the pages (HTML) when being called upon in the routes. So that when the user clicks on a particular link (Login, dashboard etc.) the pages are then rendered as requested. 

## Server
We used Express and sequeleize in the back end and then hosted the site on Heroku. The site can be seen below.
